  Determine all possible stack states at block exits. The stack size should be
  the maximum possible size, and the variables on the stack should obtain the
  maximal set of values possible at that stack position at a given point of
  program execution.

  Args:
    cfg: the graph to analyse.
    die_on_empty_pop: raise an exception if an empty stack is popped.
    reinit_stacks: reinitialise all blocks' exit stacks to be empty.
    hook_up_stack_vars: after completing the analysis, propagate entry stack
                        values into blocks.
    hook_up_jumps: Connect any new edges that can be inferred after performing
                   the analysis
    mutate_jumps: JUMPIs with known conditions become JUMPs (or are deleted)
    generate_throws: JUMP and JUMPI instructions with invalid destinations
                     become THROW and THROWIs
    mutate_blockwise: hook up stack vars and/or hook up jumps after each block
                      rather than after the whole analysis is complete.
    clamp_large_stacks: if stacks start growing without bound, reduce the stack
                        size in order to hasten convergence.

  If we have already reached complete information about our stack CFG structure
  and stack states, we can use die_on_empty_pop and reinit_stacks to discover
  places where empty stack exceptions will be thrown.
