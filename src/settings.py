"""settings.py: dataflow analysis settings.

max_iterations:
  The maximum number of times to perform the graph analysis step.
  A negative value means no maximum. No limit by default.

bailout_seconds:
  Break out of the analysis loop if the time spent exceeds this value.
  Not a hard cap as subsequent analysis steps are required, and at least one
  iteration will always be performed. A negative value means no maximum.
  No limit by default.

remove_unreachable:
  Upon completion of the analysis, if there are blocks unreachable from the
  contract root, remove them. False by default.

die_on_empty_pop:
  Raise an exception if an empty stack is popped. False by default.

skip_stack_on_overflow:
  Do not apply changes to exit stacks after a symbolic overflow occurrs
  in their blocks. True by default.

reinit_stacks:
  Reinitialise all blocks' exit stacks to be empty. True by default.

hook_up_stack_vars:
  After completing the analysis, propagate entry stack values into blocks.
  True by default.

hook_up_jumps:
  Connect any new edges that can be inferred after performing the analysis.
  True by default.

mutate_jumps:
  JUMPIs with known conditions become JUMPs (or are deleted). False by default.

generate_throws:
  JUMP and JUMPI instructions with invalid destinations become THROW and
  THROWIs. False by default.

final_mutate_jumps:
  Mutate jumps in the final analysis phase. False by default.

final_generate_throws:
  generate throws in the final analysis phase. True by default.

mutate_blockwise:
  Hook up stack vars and/or hook up jumps after each block rather than after
  the whole analysis is complete. True by default.

clamp_large_stacks:
  If stacks start growing without bound, reduce the maximum stack size in order
  to hasten convergence. True by default.

clamp_stack_minimum:
  Stack sizes will not be clamped smaller than this value. Default value is 20.

widen_variables:
  If any computed variable's number of possible values exceeds a given threshold,
  widen its value to Top. True by default.

widen_threshold:
  Widen if the size of a given variable exceeds this value.
  Default value is 10.

set_valued_ops:
  If True, apply arithmetic operations to variables with multiple values;
  otherwise, only apply them to variables whose value is definite.
  True by default.

analytics:
  If true, dataflow analysis will return a dict of information about
  the contract, otherwise return an empty dict. False by default.

Note: If we have already reached complete information about our stack CFG
structure and stack states, we can use die_on_empty_pop and reinit_stacks
to discover places where empty stack exceptions will be thrown.
